# Python-week--1
# DAY 1: INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
Installing python,jupyter notebook.
Python file: ipynb
Python data structures: with examples
-List=[2,4,6,8,10]
-Set={'a','b','c','d'}
-Tuple=((42,"Hello"),("Me",4))
-Dictionary=[{"name":"Lona","Age":40}]
Managed to test Jupyter and running the lines of code based on data structures.It is not important to put the elements of a set in order and in a list it's important.
Tuples cannot be modified when declared.Operators-instruction that perform operations on variables and values in python.Most familiar operator in python(Arithmetic operator for mathematics calculations:  +,*.
Boolean operators: OR, NOT, AND.
Python function is declared or defined as 'Def'.Conditional statements( if, elif & else)

# DAY 2 : CLASSES & OBJECTS
Class,instance,method/function.
After creating a class,there has to be a new instance of a class.
Init -it's important to initialize so that a method can take arguments.
      # Factorial
      -gives the number of possible arrangements of a set of items/length "n"
      E.G 4!= 4*3*2*1
      The factorial of 0 returns 1 , as it has 1 posssible arrangement/length
      If a factorial is negative(-) & a float ,it returns NONE.
